      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team3 = [...players];
      console.log(team3);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",

      const cap = person; // not, this is reference, not a copy !!!

      // how do we take a copy instead?

      console.log(cap2, person);

      // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
      const cap3 = { ...person };
      console.log(cap3);
